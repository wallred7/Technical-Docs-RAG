{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Introduction\n","\n","This notebook contains a script for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using the Llama Index RAG framework [9], Milvus vector store [5], HuggingFace models [2,5], and TruLens evaluation [1]. The most prevalent approach to RAG leverages OpenAI's embeddings and inference model. This is apparent through the number of tutorials that use OpenAI in RAG systems [3,5,6,9,10]. However, there are a vast number of models available [7,8,9]. So there is value in exploring RAG performance of non-OpenAI alternatives. In this script, the embedding model was chosen from the HuggingFace leaderboard of embedding models [7]. The notebook experimented with the Gemma 2B [12] and Gemma 7B [13] due to its recent release, SoTA performance, and rising popularity."],"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"2a78704317440b99"},"id":"2a78704317440b99"},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":["# Clears the output of certain cells to maintain a cleaner notebook appearance\n","from IPython.display import clear_output"],"metadata":{"id":"4f6ed60bc70cbe0a","ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-02-26T11:56:08.832488Z","start_time":"2024-02-26T11:56:08.818631Z"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709204028351,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"William Allred","userId":"07616141287706591162"}}},"id":"4f6ed60bc70cbe0a","execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"initial_id","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"initial_id","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709204075996,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":47652,"user":{"displayName":"William Allred","userId":"07616141287706591162"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# pip installations\n","!pip install llama-index\n","!pip install pymilvus\n","!pip install milvus\n","!pip install \"transformers[torch]\"\n","!pip install openai\n","clear_output(0) # output will clear after n wait time"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# colab % pip installations\n","%pip install llama-index-vector-stores-milvus\n","%pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface\n","%pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai\n","%pip install llama-index-llms-huggingface\n","clear_output()"],"metadata":{"id":"VNrakxL3LWZT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709204116719,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":40735,"user":{"displayName":"William Allred","userId":"07616141287706591162"}}},"id":"VNrakxL3LWZT","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data, Embeddings, & Inference"],"metadata":{"id":"zmlOH0sngWUR"},"id":"zmlOH0sngWUR"},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":["# imports\n","from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader, Settings\n","from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding\n","from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding\n","from llama_index.llms.huggingface import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI"],"metadata":{"id":"1a177d20aecfa61c","ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-02-26T11:57:01.980816Z","start_time":"2024-02-26T11:56:41.528597Z"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709204125405,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":8696,"user":{"displayName":"William Allred","userId":"07616141287706591162"}}},"id":"1a177d20aecfa61c","execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Read the Document\n","# links to a directory and reads in the relevant files.\n","# ./ points to the local dir.\n","docs = SimpleDirectoryReader('./').load_data()\n","\n","docs[0].extra_info"],"metadata":{"id":"o9lXN3_lAyJc","ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-02-26T11:57:17.549211Z","start_time":"2024-02-26T11:57:04.825676Z"},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709204128831,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":3442,"user":{"displayName":"William Allred","userId":"07616141287706591162"}},"outputId":"84033e0e-5c30-43f0-abdc-0d477821f29c"},"id":"o9lXN3_lAyJc","execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'page_label': '1',\n"," 'file_name': '/content/MOOC-2 HumanSensing.pdf',\n"," 'file_path': '/content/MOOC-2 HumanSensing.pdf',\n"," 'file_type': 'application/pdf',\n"," 'file_size': 24406576,\n"," 'creation_date': '2024-02-29',\n"," 'last_modified_date': '2024-02-29',\n"," 'last_accessed_date': None}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# define function for embedding model to be used\n","\n","def define_embeddings_model(service: str, _model_name: str = None):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Initializes and sets the embedding model based on the specified service.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","    - service (str): The embedding service to use.

Llama Index provided extensive documentation that was essential. I recommend opening the vector store to the student's discretion. There are many companies creating their own vector databases and it would be a helpful exercise to review popular technologies and make a selection. I was unimpressed by Milvus so, if you would rather not have students make an open selection, I would change the recommended service from Milvus to Chroma DB.\n","\n","Next, I would encourage use of non-OpenAI services. There is little doubt that OpenAI is the industry standard and their models are commonly the benchmarks with which new models are compared. However, it is beneficial to go through the exercise of embedding and inference model selection because it teaches students the resources they need to make those decisions. There are many situations where smaller models are a better choice than the extremely large GPT models.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"93Vq-_S-765A"},"id":"93Vq-_S-765A"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Citations\n","\n","[1] “🤗 HuggingFace - 🦑 TruLens.” Accessed: Feb. 29, 2024.
